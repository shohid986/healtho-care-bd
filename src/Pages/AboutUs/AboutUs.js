                            <p>It all began in 1986 when Multiple Sclerosis Limited (MSL) identified the need for high-quality care services for people living with this chronic disease.</p>
                            <p>By 1999, MSL recognised the time had come to establish NanoCare as a separate legal entity. A savvy and experienced Board was appointed and we were firmly on the path to growth.</p>
                            <p>This growth was boosted by a series of acquisitions within the care sector between 2001 and 2008. By then, we had earned a reputation as an experienced and sizeable private care service provider.</p>

                            <p>In 2010, the purchase and integration of Nationwide Health & Aged Care Services represented a major milestone in our growth as specialist cleaning and laundry services bolstered our business portfolio.</p>
                            <p>At around the same time, NanoCare partnered with the US-based Healthcare at Home.  In 2013, NanoCare acquired the business. This nurse-led service has provided a safe, high-quality alternative to hospital care for people with cancer and chronic disease.</p>
                            <p>Today, we are proud to continue our work as a wholly-owned, not-for-profit subsidiary of MSL</p>
